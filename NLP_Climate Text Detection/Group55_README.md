## Project Overview

This repository consists of files required to run/ test the outputs of our models for COMP90042 A3 Project

## Notebooks
- **Group55_COMP90042_Project_2025.ipynb**: Main Model Notebook consisting of all the code blocks we require to run and test the retrieval  and classification corresponding to the main model report results  
- **Retrieval_Other_Results.ipynb**: Notebook consisting of intermediate retrieval models whose results have been reported 
- **Classification_Other_Results.ipynb**: Notebook consisting of intermediate classification model whose results have been reported 

## Note while running these notebooks
- The notebooks specify how to run the code. Also, they come with the ourputs inline which correspond to the reported results. 

## Note on input data files and data generated during model run
- No input raw data is added to the zip however data provided by the teaching team is used to build the models
- The models save outputs/ data for later inference during code run but these are not added in the zip as they get created during the code run 
- There are empty folders (namely: output, saves and data) on the drive to mimic the repo as it was and to retain the same structure

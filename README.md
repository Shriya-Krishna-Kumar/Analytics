## üìÅ Computer Vision X-Ray Detection

**Description:**  
This project leverages deep learning for medical image classification, aiming to identify and detect anomalies in chest X-ray images (e.g., pneumonia or tuberculosis). The pipeline involves image preprocessing, data augmentation, CNN-based model training (e.g., ResNet or EfficientNet), and evaluation using metrics such as accuracy and AUC.

**Skills & Tools:**  
- Python, PyTorch / TensorFlow  
- OpenCV, PIL  
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  
- Data augmentation & transfer learning  
- Medical imaging best practices

## üìÅ EDA MoiraFloodAnalysis

**Description:**  
An exploratory spatial analysis of the 2022 Victorian floods, specifically focusing on the Moira region. This project investigates flood-prone areas in relation to dam and retarding basin locations using GIS data, satellite imagery, and spatial statistics. Key techniques include kernel density estimation, local Moran's I, overlay analysis, and DEM terrain modeling.

**Skills & Tools:**  
- Python, GeoPandas, Rasterio, Shapely  
- Kriging, IDW interpolation  
- Spatial autocorrelation (Moran‚Äôs I)  
- DEM analysis and floodplain mapping  
- Sentinel-2 satellite data processing

## üìÅ NLP_Climate Text Detection

**Description:**  
This NLP project focuses on climate-related misinformation detection in textual content. It explores fine-tuning language models (TinyBERT, RoBERTa) and integrates multi-level attention mechanisms for context-sensitive classification. The goal is to distinguish factual vs. misleading climate-related statements.

**Skills & Tools:**  
- Python, HuggingFace Transformers  
- BERT / TinyBERT  
- Multi-level attention models  
- Text classification  
- Ethics-aware AI design principles
